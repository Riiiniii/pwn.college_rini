# Challenge Name
Interrupting processes 

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{MAxzolHuLF3QoGS9r1GK_uMhvhQ.QXzQDO0wyM3MzNzEzW}`

```bash
Connected!
hacker@processes~interrupting-processes:~$ /challenge/run
I could give you the flag... but I won't, until this process exits. Remember,
you can force me to exit with Ctrl-C. Try it now!
^C
Good job! You have used Ctrl-C to interrupt this process! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{MAxzolHuLF3QoGS9r1GK_uMhvhQ.QXzQDO0wyM3MzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I learnt that "control+c" key can be used to interrupt processes. This is used when you just want to get rid of a process that is clogging up your terminal. 
## References 
None.
