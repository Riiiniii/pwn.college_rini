# Challenge Name
Redirecting output

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{csl95TbIOzoHrXy0TXCertw0WvW.QX0YTN0wyM3MzNzEzW}`

```bash
Connected!
You have created the COLLEGE file and wrote the right value to it, but it
doesn't look like you did it via input redirection.
hacker@piping~redirecting-output:~$ echo PWN > COLLEGE
Correct! You successfully redirected 'PWN' to the file 'COLLEGE'! Here is your
flag:
pwn.college{csl95TbIOzoHrXy0TXCertw0WvW.QX0YTN0wyM3MzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I learnt the use of the "echo" command. 
echo a > b , a is redirected to b. so basically b gets the value of a.
## References 
None.
