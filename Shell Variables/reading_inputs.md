# Challenge Name
Reading inputs

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{AHNjNvcR_MEVCED_qoumJh0n8TA.QX4cTN0wyM3MzNzEzW}`

```bash
Connected!
hacker@variables~reading-input:~$ read -p "input: " PWN
input: COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{AHNjNvcR_MEVCED_qoumJh0n8TA.QX4cTN0wyM3MzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I learnt how to read inputs for variables here.
firstly, "read -p "textshowntouser" <nameofvariable>"
and then we can "$nameofvariable" to show us the variable.

## References 
None.
