## What I learned
I learnt how to initialise variables. It is also important to remember that while initialising a variable, there must be no space before or after the = as that would make the shell consider it as a command which is not the case. 
We must also note that the shell is case sensitive, so abc is not the same as ABC. So a=123 is right while a = 123 is not.
