You cannot use the 'cd' command in this level, and must retrieve the flag by
absolute path. Plus, I hid the flag in a different directory! You can find it
in the file /usr/include/netinet/flag. Go cat it out **without** cding into
that directory!
hacker@commands~more-catting-practice:~$ cat file /usr/include/netinet/flag
cat: file: No such file or directory
pwn.college{IlQItB1D0v6Z65bdLqaumDvQZtP.QXwITO0wyM3MzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I learnt more about the 'cat' command.
